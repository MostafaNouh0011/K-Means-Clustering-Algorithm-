# K-Means-Clustering-Algorithm-
Step by step unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering


Python implementation for k-means on data that Andrew Ng explained in his ML course in 2011 by MATLAB


# Here is two clear steps we do:
- Selection:
    selecting each point to their closest centroid
- Displacement:
    move each centroid to heart of its group
